This is a short note to understand my implementation on this task:

1.)  I have created two folders.

2.)  One for backend -  express,node.js, mongodb

3.)  One for Frontend - reactJS

4.)  I have created a authentication in backend for user registration and login using jwt verifcation.

5.)   Connected fronted reactjs to backend  using cors policy.
   
6.)   Implemented a functionality of signup and login in frontend.
     
7.)   Didn't able to store jwt in cookies.
     
8.)   90% reponsiveness implemented in frontend.

9.)   Frontend is running at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

10.)  Backend is running at  http://localhost:9090/ 


*** I skipped the implementation of mysql, I used mongodb for database.
