# osmosis-task


This is a short note to understand my implementation on this task:

1.)  I have created two folders.
2.)  One for backend -  express,node.js, mongodb
3.)  One for Frontend - reactJS
4.)  I have created a authentication in backend for user registration and login using jwt verifcation.
5.   Connected fronted reactjs to backend  using cors policy.
6.)   Implemented a functionality of signup and login in frontend.
7.)   Didn't able to store jwt in cookies.
8.)   90% reponsiveness implemented in frontend.
9.)   Frontend is running at http://127.0.0.1:5173/
10.)  Backend is running at  http://localhost:9090/ 


*** I skipped the implementation of mysql, I used mongodb for database
